A Star wars reactive microservice platform, formed by four services:
* **StarWarsMovie:** ````Rest API```` microservice. The entry point of the platform which orchestrate and gather the information for the client.
* **StarWarsActors:** ````WebSocket```` microservice. It contains the information of characters per episode.
* **StarWarsPlanets:** ````gRPC```` microservice. It contains the information of planets per episode.
* **StarWarsShips:** ````Kafka```` microservice. It contains the information of ships per episode.

In this platform, we apply different reactive technologies not only to communicate between microservice,
but also to be NIO and control side-effect.

As Http Server technology we use [Vertx](https://vertx.io) in his latest version, which provide the different patterns to
communicate between services like ````WebSocket```` or ```gRPC```

For ````Event driven```` pattern we use  [Kafka Alpakka](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka-kafka/current/home.html) a Kafka
 Akka library implemented in top of Apache Kafka.

For ```NIO``` and ```Side-effects```  we use functional programing library [Vavr](https://www.vavr.io) 
which provide a ```Future```, ```Option```, ```Try``` and ```Either``` like in Scala lang.

### Building

In each gradle module you can run the different task using gradle commands:

To launch your tests:
```
./gradlew clean test
```

To package your application:
```
./gradlew clean assemble
```


### Running

* Before run the platform is mandatory have Kafka image up and running.
Having docker-compose installed run in the root folder of project the command:
````
docker-compose up -d
````

* To run the four microservice you can use the main class of the ```TestFramework``` module 
[here](TestFramework/src/main/java/com/politrons/main/startWarsPlatformMain.java)
